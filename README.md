# Arcane Theme

Arcane, a lightweight and mobile-friendly refresh of my legacy Obsidian theme [Dracula + LYT](https://github.com/xRyul/ObsidianMD_Dracula_x_LYT?tab=readme-ov-file#dracula--lyt)

## Design Philosophy

The Arcane theme was initially designed as a [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) theme, utilizing a 16-color palette composed of 8 shades and 8 accents. The beauty of this approach is its flexibility and simplicity. Want a new theme every week or month? Simply replace the main 8 color variables in the `.css` file. Whether you're aiming for the aesthetics of DOOM EMACS, DARK ONE, ATOM, or NORD, all it takes is a change of 8 colors. No more fiddling with complex color schemes!

However, everything changed when I came across `#88c0d4`, a soft, muted cyan that I absolutely adore. Every time I open my vault, this color palette evokes feelings of clarity, calmness, and freshness. It was then that I decided to make this color a permanent fixture in the Arcane theme.

Enjoy the Arcane theme and happy note-taking!
